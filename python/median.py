# Median and Sum of Absolute Deviations

# The median of a set of numbers is the value that minimizes the sum of a
# bsolute deviations from all points in the set. For a set of nn sorted 
# numbers x1,x2,â€¦,xn the median M has the property that it 
# minimizes the sum abs(M - xi) is minimum

# given array of locations we need to find two location where 
# sum of distances from all other locations is minimum
